# GifTastic-API

 ### Overview

 *Using the GIPHY API, we can make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. We use GIPHY API, JavaScript, and jQuery to change the HTML of our site.

 ### GIPHY API and Key

  * Like many APIs, GIPHY requires developers to use a key to access their API data. Sign up for a free GIPHY account and obtain an API Key through this link: (https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/?create=true).
  * Make sure to use **`https`**, or the app may not work properly when deployed to Github Pages.
